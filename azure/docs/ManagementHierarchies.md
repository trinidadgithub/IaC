Organizing Azure resources into accounts, resource groups, and management hierarchies is essential for managing cloud components effectively, especially as your infrastructure scales. Here’s an outline on organizing Azure resources for better management, using storage, networking, and containerized services as examples.
### 1. Azure Subscriptions for High-Level Segmentation

Use subscriptions to separate large environments or organizational divisions, such as Production, Development, and Testing. This helps with cost tracking, permissions, and billing isolation. 
Each subscription can have a separate set of permissions, resource limits, and budgets, making it easier to control access and costs at a high level.

### 2. Resource Groups for Logical Organization

Resource groups are containers within a subscription and are best organized by application, environment, or lifecycle.
Each resource group should contain resources that share a similar lifecycle and permission requirements. For example, storage accounts, blob containers, virtual networks, and VMs for a single application can reside in the same resource group.

**Examples:**

- Storage: Group storage accounts and blob containers together in resource groups based on their application or use case (e.g., a resource group for app-storage-dev for development storage needs).
- Networking: Create separate resource groups for networking resources like virtual networks, subnets, and firewalls if they’re shared across applications or environments.
- Compute and Containers: For containerized applications or Kubernetes clusters, group related resources, such as AKS clusters, container registries, and log analytics workspaces, within the same resource group to simplify management.

### 3. Use Management Groups for Multi-Subscription Management

Management Groups are ideal for enterprises managing multiple Azure subscriptions. You can apply policies, budgets, and access controls at the management group level, cascading them down to all subscriptions within that group.
For example, you might have a Development Management Group that contains all development subscriptions, each with their own resource groups organized by environment or project.

### 4. Best Practices for Organizing Common Azure Resources
**Storage**

Use a resource group to contain all related storage accounts and blob containers, logically organized by the application.
Use tags for further categorization, such as tagging storage accounts by Environment (e.g., Development, Production) and Owner for ownership tracking.

**Networking**

Networking resources can often be shared across multiple applications or environments, so a dedicated resource group for networking is common.
Place virtual networks, subnets, and security groups in one resource group, and apply network policies at the resource group level.

**Containers and Kubernetes Clusters**

For containerized applications, consider creating a separate resource group for each Kubernetes cluster or container application.
Place Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, Azure Container Registry (ACR), and any associated monitoring resources like Log Analytics workspaces in the same resource group. This helps manage the application stack as a cohesive unit.
Use separate resource groups for Production and Development environments to keep lifecycle management simple.

### 5. Using Azure Policies and RBAC for Consistency and Access Control

Apply Azure Policies to enforce consistency in naming conventions, locations, or allowed SKUs within resource groups or subscriptions.
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign specific permissions within resource groups. For example, assign the Network Contributor role only to users managing networking resources, and Storage Blob Data Contributor for users needing access to storage.

**Example Hierarchy for an Application**

Assume we’re building a production-level application with frontend, backend, and data storage, as well as a shared network:

    Subscription: Production Subscription
        Resource Group 1: prod-app-network
            Contains shared networking resources: virtual network, subnets, NSGs.
        Resource Group 2: prod-app-storage
            Contains storage accounts, blob containers, and possibly data warehouses.
        Resource Group 3: prod-app-compute
            Contains compute resources, such as AKS clusters, VMs, and container registries.

This structure enables easy deployment and teardown of environments and allows permissions to be tightly controlled within each component.
Summary

Organizing Azure resources using a combination of subscriptions, resource groups, management groups, tags, and RBAC helps improve management and scalability. Resource groups are a primary tool for logical organization within subscriptions, enabling you to manage resources efficiently across various environments, applications, or lifecycle stages.
