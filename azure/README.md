Getting Started with Microsoft Azure on Windows

This guide walks you through setting up your Windows workstation for Microsoft Azure development and management, as well as the steps to create an Azure account. By the end of this guide, you'll have your Azure account ready and your machine configured with essential tools for developing and managing Azure services.
Step 1: Create a Microsoft Azure Account

To start working with Azure, you first need an Azure account. Follow these steps to create one:

    Go to the Azure website:
        Visit azure.microsoft.com.

    Click "Start for free":
        On the homepage, click the "Start free" button to create an account with free services, including $200 in credit for the first 30 days.

    Sign in or create a Microsoft account:
        If you have an existing Microsoft account (e.g., for Outlook or Xbox), sign in with those credentials. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, click "Create one!" to create a new one and follow the registration steps.

    Enter billing information:
        You’ll need to provide a credit or debit card to complete the account creation. This card will not be charged unless you exceed the free tier limits.

    Verify identity:
        Microsoft will ask you to verify your identity by sending a code to your phone. Enter this code to continue.

    Agree to terms and complete registration:
        Once you agree to the terms, your Azure account is created, and you’ll be redirected to the Azure Portal.

Step 2: Set Up Your Windows Workstation for Azure Development

Now that you have an Azure account, the next step is configuring your Windows machine to work with Azure web services. Below are the essential tools and configurations required:
1. Install Azure CLI

The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to manage Azure resources from your command line.

    Download and install the Azure CLI for Windows: Visit the Azure CLI install page and follow the installation instructions.

    Verify the installation: Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run the following command:

    bash

    az --version

    This should display the installed version and confirm a successful installation.

2. Install Azure PowerShell (Optional)

If you prefer using PowerShell to manage Azure, you can install the Azure PowerShell module:

    Install the Azure PowerShell module: Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator and run:

    bash

Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Force

Verify the installation:

bash

    Get-Module -ListAvailable Az

3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Azure Extensions

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, popular code editor with powerful Azure integrations via extensions.

    Download and install Visual Studio Code: Visit Visual Studio Code and install the editor.

    Install Azure extensions: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions Marketplace, and install the following Azure-related extensions:
        Azure Account: Manage your Azure subscription.
        Azure App Service: Deploy and manage App Service instances.
        Azure Functions: Create and manage serverless Azure Functions.
        Azure Storage: Interact with Azure Storage resources like blobs and tables.

4. Install .NET SDK

Azure supports many applications built with .NET. To develop and deploy .NET applications, install the .NET SDK:

    Download and install the .NET SDK: Go to Download .NET and follow the installation instructions.

    Verify the installation: Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

    bash

    dotnet --version

5. Install Docker (Optional)

If you're working with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances, you'll need Docker to build and manage containers.

    Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows: Visit Docker Desktop and follow the installation instructions.

    Verify the installation:

    bash

    docker --version

6. Install Azure Storage Explorer (Optional)

For graphical management of Azure Storage resources like blobs, queues, and files, use Azure Storage Explorer:

    Download Azure Storage Explorer: Visit Azure Storage Explorer to download the tool.

    Sign in with your Azure account and start managing your storage resources.

7. Install Terraform (Optional)

Terraform is a popular tool for managing Azure infrastructure as code. If you plan to manage Azure resources using Terraform, install it as follows:

    Download and install Terraform for Windows: Visit Terraform Downloads and follow the instructions.

    Verify the installation:

    bash

    terraform --version

8. Sign In to Azure

After installing the necessary tools, sign in to your Azure account to start managing resources.

    Using Azure CLI:

    bash

az login

This opens a browser window where you can authenticate your Azure account.

Using Azure PowerShell:

bash

    Connect-AzAccount

Step 3: Optional - Regenerating Keys for Azure Services

When working with Azure services like Storage Accounts, SQL Databases, or App Services, you may need to regenerate access keys to enhance security. Here's how to regenerate keys:
Regenerating Storage Account Keys

    Open Azure Portal and go to Storage accounts.
    Select the storage account, then go to Access keys under Settings.
    Choose to regenerate Key1 or Key2 by clicking Regenerate next to the key.
    Update any application or service using the new key.

Regenerating Azure SQL Database Credentials

    In the Azure Portal, navigate to SQL Databases and select your database.
    Under Set server firewall, click Regenerate for the admin credentials.

Regenerating App Service Authentication Keys

    Open the Azure Portal and navigate to App Services.
    Select your app, then go to Authentication / Authorization under Settings.
    Regenerate secrets for any identity providers as needed.

Summary

By following these steps, you'll have your Azure account created and your Windows workstation fully configured to manage Azure resources. You’ll also have access to powerful tools like Azure CLI, PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and optional tools like Docker, Terraform, and Azure Storage Explorer.

Happy developing on Microsoft Azure!
