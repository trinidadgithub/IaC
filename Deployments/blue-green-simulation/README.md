[Version 1](./version-1):  This release uses a manual method to switch between a blue and green service.  It's simple and straight forward, yet effective when testing two releases of an application.

[Version 2](./version-2):  This release is an enhanced version of "version-1".  A router service was introduced to control the traffic between the blue and green services.  No manual intervention required.
