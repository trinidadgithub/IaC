# Service Onboarding Guide

Onboarding new services with respect to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices involves ensuring that new services are built with reliability, scalability, and maintainability in mind from the start. Here's a comprehensive guide to onboarding new services based on SRE principles:

1. Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
    • SLIs: Identify key metrics that will measure your service’s performance, such as latency, error rate, throughput, and availability.
    • SLOs: Establish clear SLOs that define acceptable thresholds for the SLIs (e.g., "99.9% of requests should respond within 200ms over a rolling 30-day window").
    • SLAs (if applicable): Determine Service Level Agreements (SLAs) if you have external customers, specifying the consequences of not meeting SLOs.

    • Google's SRE Handbook on SLOs: https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/
2. Set Up Monitoring and Observability
    • Metrics Collection: Implement monitoring to track critical metrics (e.g., latency, traffic, error rates, resource utilization) using tools like Prometheus, Datadog, or New Relic.
    • Logging: Set up centralized logging using tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK Stack), or Splunk to capture detailed logs from your service.
    • Tracing: Implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to gain visibility into how requests flow through your service.

3. Establish Alerting Mechanisms
    • Define Alerts: Set up alerts based on SLOs and SLIs to notify the team when issues arise, ensuring alerts are actionable and meaningful (e.g., alert when error rate exceeds 1% over a 5-minute period).
    • Alert Prioritization: Categorize alerts by severity (e.g., critical, warning, info) to reduce alert fatigue.
    • Use Incident Management Tools: Integrate with incident management tools like PagerDuty or Opsgenie to ensure alerts reach the right people.

    • Google's Guide to Alerting: https://sre.google/sre-book/alerting-on-slos/
4. Implement Reliability and Resilience Testing
    • Chaos Engineering: Use chaos engineering tools like Chaos Monkey or Gremlin to simulate failures and ensure the service can handle unexpected disruptions.
    • Load Testing: Perform load testing using tools like Apache JMeter, Locust, or Gatling to understand how the service behaves under high traffic.

5. Ensure Proper Capacity Planning and Scalability
    • Capacity Planning: Estimate the resources needed to handle expected traffic, and ensure you have enough capacity to manage peak loads.
    • Auto-Scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies to adjust resources dynamically based on traffic patterns or resource usage.

    • Capacity Planning Guide: https://sre.google/sre-book/capacity-planning/
6. Establish Robust Deployment and Rollback Processes
    • Automated Deployments: Use CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions) to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
    • Blue-Green or Canary Deployments: Implement deployment strategies like blue-green or canary deployments to minimize the impact of new releases and enable quick rollbacks if needed.

7. Set Up Access Controls and Security Practices
    • Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the service and its resources.
    • Secrets Management: Use secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to handle sensitive data securely.

8. Implement Robust Backup and Disaster Recovery
    • Regular Backups: Set up regular backups for critical data and configuration settings to ensure data recovery in case of failure.
    • Disaster Recovery Testing: Test your disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure you can recover from outages or data loss effectively.

9. Conduct a Production Readiness Review (PRR)
    • PRR Checklist: Perform a Production Readiness Review to ensure that your service meets SRE standards. Key areas to review include:
        ○ Monitoring and alerting setup
        ○ SLOs and SLIs definition
        ○ Backup and recovery processes
        ○ Security and access controls
        ○ Documentation and runbooks

10. Create and Maintain Documentation and Runbooks
    • Service Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation covering the service architecture, dependencies, SLOs, operational procedures, and troubleshooting steps.
    • Runbooks: Develop runbooks for common issues and incidents to provide on-call engineers with step-by-step instructions for resolving problems.

11. Develop a Postmortem Culture
    • Incident Postmortems: After an incident, conduct a blameless postmortem to identify root causes, document lessons learned, and implement preventive measures.
    • Continuous Improvement: Use insights from postmortems to improve the service’s reliability and reduce the likelihood of similar incidents.

    • Postmortem Culture: https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/
12. Ongoing Maintenance and Continuous Improvement
    • Regular Audits: Periodically audit the service for compliance with SRE practices and update documentation, runbooks, and configurations as needed.
    • Error Budget Policies: Use error budgets to balance reliability with feature development, ensuring that the service remains stable while allowing for innovation.

By following this comprehensive guide for onboarding new services using SRE practices, you ensure that services are reliable, scalable, and maintainable from day one, ultimately enhancing the overall stability and performance of your infrastructure.
